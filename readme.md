The most widely used strategy varies by context:
- Intraday traders may favor **VWAP** or RSI.
- Swing traders and investors often rely on **MACD** and **Moving Average Crossover**.
- Among these, **MACD** ranks as one of the most popular due to its versatility in capturing trends and momentum.

Each strategy should be tested and adapted to the market conditions and trading style for optimal results.
